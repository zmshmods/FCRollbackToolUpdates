  "desc": "The Gameplay Refresh update is now available for all versions of EA SPORTS FC 25, and it’s the most significant mid-season gameplay overhaul we’ve ever made based on your feedback, including:\n\n- Major updates to core gameplay systems like passing, shooting, goalkeeping, and defending.\n- Addressed issues like defenders catching up to dribblers too often.\n- More offensively fluid gameplay enabling you to move the ball easier.\n- Reduced tacklebacks and AI interceptions.\n\nTo learn more about these changes, be sure to [check out our Pitch Notes article.](https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/fc-25-pitch-notes-gameplay-refresh-update \"‌\")\n\n### Gameplay\n\nMade the following changes:\n\n- Significantly reduced effectiveness of first-time Lofted Through Passes.\n- Players are now able to provide quicker support when they are familiar with their Role.\n- Increased intelligence of attacking and supporting runs made by AI teammates.\n- Improved AI teammate attacking run quality when trying to beat the offside line.\n- AI teammates can better hold their runs when near the line and get back onside more quickly.\n- Improved effectiveness of Inside and Advance Forwards.\n- They can move farther up the pitch.\n- They can better evaluate when to run into space or occupy a position.\n- Offensive players can now operate in attacking spaces near other attackers instead of stopping their runs.\n- Attacking players can continue their runs more often, excluding offside scenarios.\n- Increased accuracy and shot speed from inside the box for regular and Finesse shots.\n- Slightly increased accuracy of low difficulty regular and Finesse shots in the box.\n- Slightly increased the impact of Attributes on the accuracy of Finesse shots taken by players without the Finesse Shot or Finesse Shot+ PlayStyles.\n- A series of changes have been made aimed at reducing tacklebacks, which is when the opposing player wins the ball back after the defender makes a tackle.\n  - Defenders with the Anticipate PlayStyle are now more likely to tackle the ball towards a teammate with more space if stopping the ball in place would be disadvantageous.\n  - Improved the quality of touches defenders can make on tackles.\n  - In some cases, the ball carrier could have unintentionally stumbled forward when being tackled, resulting in incorrectly winning the ball back.\n  - In some cases, the defender could have stumbled when running towards the ball after a successful tackle rather than gaining possession.\n- In Competitive Ultimate Team and Online Seasons ruleset matches slightly increased defensive line width for 4 defender formations when the ball is inside of the box, and when the ball is close to the defensive line itself.\n- In Competitive Ultimate Team and Online Seasons ruleset matches slightly decreased defensive line width for 3 defender formations in general.\n- In Competitive Ultimate Team and Online Seasons ruleset matches, AI defenders will mark dribblers less tightly and will be less likely to cover shooting lanes near the edge of the box.\n- Triggered Runs can once again be requested while Controlled Sprint Dribbling.\n- Slightly increased speed of normal Ground Passes.\n- Significantly increased effectiveness of Semi Assisted Through Passes.\n- Slightly increased accuracy of short Ground Passes to open players.\n- Moderately reduced accuracy of headed passes in contested situations.\n- Further decreased how often AI players are able to make successful interceptions.\n- Defenders will focus more on man marking when defending counter attacks starting from corners.\n- The intent of this change is to provide more effective defensive positioning against counter attacks originating from corners.\n- RM/LM players with the Winger Balanced Role can drop deeper when defending.\n- Goalkeepers will now position themselves slightly closer to the near post.\n- The intent of this change is for goalkeepers to more effectively cover near post shots.\n\nAddressed the following issues:\n\n- Addressed instances of players catching up to the ball carrier despite the ball carrier having much higher Pace Attributes.\n- In some cases, the ball carrier could have unintentionally stumbled forward after a successful tackle, resulting in them incorrectly winning the ball back.\n- Goalkeepers could sometimes incorrectly step away from the near post in tight angle shooting situations.\n- Falsebacks could stay central for too long when the team lost possession.\n- They will now immediately look to return to their LB/RB positions.\n- Low powered Ground Passes were sometimes being delivered to farther players than intended.\n- Medium powered passes sometimes focused too much on the player’s aim input instead of the amount of power generated.\n- Addressed some instances where first time passes and shots were less responsive than intended when the input was performed late.\n- Reduced the effectiveness of tackles from behind in certain situations.\n- In some cases, simple physical contact could have resulted in the ball carrier losing the ball more easily than intended.\n- When playing against the CPU AI, it was triggering more Directed Runs than intended.\n- Sometimes, the dribbler could have pushed the ball too far away from themselves when turning.\n- The player could have incorrectly run past the ball when performing a Flair Jog Nutmeg or when Strafe Dribbling.\n- In certain situations, the Player Switch to the pass receiver did not occur.\n- In some cases, teammates could have accidentally dispossessed each other.\n- In Rush matches, players could have gotten stuck on the goal posts in rare situations.\n- Calling for a teammate to come short did not always function as intended when requested on the wings.\n- In some cases, defenders were not correctly positioning themselves when attempting to track runs, resulting in slow backwards runs while facing the ball.\n- Addressed instances of players moving slowly despite inputs requesting them to move quickly or sprint.\n- Improved referee logic when determining foul calls involving Skill Moves in the box.\n- Addressed instances of incorrect player placement during Rush penalties.\n- Addressed instances of incorrect player switching occurring after a blocked pass, during air balls when Secondary Contain was used, or during inaccurate Lob Passes.\n- Players could sometimes take longer than intended to recover after having a kick blocked.\n- In some cases, a long recovery animation could have occurred when the ball was passing through a player’s legs, preventing them from responding to the situation quickly.\n\n### Ultimate Team\n\nAddressed the following issue:\n\n- When using Multi Swap in SBCs, the button callout for navigating to the right did not always function as intended.\n\n### Career Mode\n\nAddressed the following issues:\n\n- The CPU AI goalkeeper could have incorrectly kicked the ball out of play in some cases.\n- Some Tactical Visions featured unintended Tactics and Roles.\n- In Manager Career, Youth Potential was not present on the Youth Development Plan screen.\n- In Manager Career, some manager hairstyles could unintentionally change.\n\n### Clubs\n\nAddressed the following issue:\n\n- Addressed instances of Avatars gaining bypassing height restrictions in some situations.\n\n### General, Audio, and Visual\n\nMade the following changes:\n\n- Updated some kits, clothing, and equipment.\n- Updated 125 star heads which will become visible in-game following a Server Release.\n\nWant to provide us direct feedback about EA SPORTS FC 25?

wins the ball back after the defender makes a tackle.\n  - Defenders with the Anticipate PlayStyle are now more likely to tackle the ball towards a teammate with more space if stopping the ball in place would be disadvantageous.\n  - Improved the quality of touches defenders can make on tackles.\n  - In some cases, the ball carrier could have unintentionally stumbled forward when being tackled, resulting in incorrectly winning the ball back.\n  - In some cases, the defender could have stumbled when running towards the ball after a successful tackle rather than gaining possession.\n- In

defensive line itself.\n- In Competitive Ultimate Team and Online Seasons ruleset matches slightly decreased defensive line width for 3 defender formations in general.\n- In Competitive Ultimate Team

accuracy of short Ground Passes to open players.\n- Moderately reduced accuracy of headed passes in contested situations.\n- Further decreased how often AI players are able to make successful

counter attacks originating from corners.\n- RM/LM players with the Winger Balanced Role can drop deeper when defending.\n- Goalkeepers will now position themselves slightly closer to the near post.\n- The intent of this change is for goalkeepers to more effectively cover near post shots.\n\nAddressed the following issues:\n\n- Addressed instances of players catching up to the ball carrier despite the ball carrier having much higher Pace Attributes.\n- In some cases, the ball carrier could have unintentionally stumbled forward after a successful tackle, resulting in them incorrectly winning the ball back.\n- Goalkeepers could sometimes incorrectly step away from the near post in tight angle shooting situations.\n- Falsebacks could stay central for too long when the team lost possession.\n- They will now immediately look to return to their LB/RB positions.\n- Low powered Ground Passes were sometimes being delivered to farther players than intended.\n- Medium powered passes sometimes focused too much on the player’s aim input instead of the amount of power generated.\n- Addressed some instances where first time passes and shots were less responsive than intended when the input was performed late.\n- Reduced the effectiveness of tackles from behind in certain situations.\n- In some cases, simple physical contact could have resulted in the ball carrier losing the ball
