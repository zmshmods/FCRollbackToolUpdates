button callout could disappear.\n\n- Improved some UI transitions. \n\n- When editing My Pro, some hairstyles could be missing from the preview.\n- After the match, on the post-match screen, the Pro displayed on the player card could be incorrect.\n\n**General, Audio, and Visual**\n\nMade the following changes:\n\n- Added 10 Classic XI teams to Kick off.\n- The teams will be available through a server release soon after the Holiday Update.\n- Refreshed the main menu to match the holiday spirit.\n- The refreshed menu will go live through a server release soon after the Holiday Update.\n-
